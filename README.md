# About Me

## Who Am I?
Hello! I am a student in computer sciences who has always been fascinated by coding because of the flexibility and the wonders you can do with it.
My journey in computer science has been an incredible adventure, starting with basic programming and slowly evolving into exploring complex algorithms and innovative technologies.


## What I Do
Currently, I am involved in learning about different topics, and I'm quite intrigued by data sciences and AI. I have a passion for understanding how data can be transformed into valuable insights and strive to create impactful and intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems.

## Hobbies and Interests
Outside of my professional life, I am an avid bookworm. Reading is my jam; it helps me decompress but also transports me into another world. I also love doing sports such as pilates, weight-lifting, or running. Whether it's losing myself in a novel, perfecting my pilates form, or feeling the rush of a good run, I always find joy in these activities.
